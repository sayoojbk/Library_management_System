PROBLEM:


Manual Segmentation as we know takes
practical hours which may be crucial in
some cases where fast diagnosis is 
required and our company's tech 
can provide the basis for fast diagnosis
and help in this process.

Manual segmentation of Retinal images
makes use of certain types of dyes 
which is scientifically proven to be
harmful which aren't required in 
our segmetation process.
 

 SOLUTION:

A portal for doctors and MRI imaging centers which allow imaging centers to upload the MRI images and our application will provide the analysis of the MRI scans directly to the doctor. And a database and progress of the treatment can be recorded without much hassle.
